Pathfinder Race Creator:
A custom content creation tool for the tabletop RPG Pathfinder aimed at making the creation process for various factors of the 
game easier and faster. Currently the only available features of the application are the base version of the race creation minus 
the saving capabilities. Future additions are planned to include, saving into HTML, .jpg, and .docx format, item creation, class creation,
city creation, and possibly more.

Project is built with c# using the visual studios windows forms for quicker creation
